We are planning to do these challange as our first step:
Note that the picture is taken by Hammer satallite with RGB colors

### ‚úÖ Step 1: **Preprocess**
1. **Convert to grayscale or use Y channel only** (space images often benefit from this).
2. **Denoise** using:
   - `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising()` or
   - `skimage.restoration.denoise_wavelet()`

```python
from skimage import io
from skimage.restoration import denoise_wavelet
img = io.imread("earth.jpg", as_gray=True)
denoised = denoise_wavelet(img, multichannel=False)
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: **Use ESRGAN or Real-ESRGAN (Trained on Natural/Remote Sensing Images)**

üß† If you're serious, try **custom-trained Real-ESRGAN** models for remote sensing:

- üîó **Pretrained ESRGAN for Satellite Images**:
  - [https://github.com/TencentARC/Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/Real-ESRGAN)
  - Look for or train on **space / remote sensing datasets** like:
    - UC Merced Land Use Dataset
    - SpaceNet
    - EuroSAT

üîß **Run Real-ESRGAN CLI**:
```bash
python inference_realesrgan.py -n RealESRGAN_x4plus -i input.jpg --outscale 4
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: **Postprocess**
1. **Contrast stretch** to enhance subtle features:
```python
from skimage import exposure
adjusted = exposure.rescale_intensity(upscaled_img)
```

2. **Edge enhancement or high-pass filtering** (for clouds, terrain outlines):
```python
kernel = np.array([[-1,-1,-1], [-1, 9,-1], [-1,-1,-1]])
sharpened = cv2.filter2D(upscaled_img, -1, kernel)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: **Scientific Color Calibration**
- If you're working with multispectral bands (like Sentinel or MODIS), align and color-correct.
- Use **false-color mapping** if needed (for infrared, etc.).

## üõ∞Ô∏è Specialized AI Models for Earth/Space Images

If you're training your own or searching GitHub:

| Model              | Notes |
|--------------------|-------|
| **DCSCN / FSRCNN** | Lightweight models, used in satellite super-res research |
| **HiFiSR**         | High-fidelity SR with fidelity loss ‚Äì ideal for preserving scientific detail |
| **ESRGAN (with Earth dataset)** | Great if retrained on Earth or Space datasets |
| **DUF (Deep Video SR)** | For enhancing satellite video frames |
